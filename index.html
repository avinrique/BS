        <h1>Business Report: Reducing Food Waste in Indian Retail through Event-based Product Repurposing</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            As a team committed to addressing the alarming levels of food waste in India, we embarked on a research project
            focusing on the retail sector, where 13% of the 74 million tons of food wasted annually comes from supermarkets and
            smaller markets. This journey led us to several discussions with retailers such as Village Mart (Avalahalli), Spar
            Market (Yelahanka), Big Mart (Yelahanka), and MiniMart. Based on our findings, we developed a solution to repurpose
            nearly expired products for events, aiming to reduce waste and simultaneously create a profitable business model.
        </p>
        <p>
            This report outlines the research conducted, the insights gathered, and the business concept we devised to tackle this
            pressing issue.
        </p>

        <h2>Research Methodology</h2>
        <h3>Retailer Conversations</h3>
        <p>
            During our initial research phase, we spoke with a range of supermarkets and smaller retail outlets, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Village Mart (Avalahalli)</li>
            <li>Spar Market (Yelahanka)</li>
            <li>Big Mart (Yelahanka)</li>
            <li>MiniMart</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The insights from these stores formed the foundation of our understanding of how supermarkets handle nearly expired
            products and helped us identify gaps in the current system that lead to unnecessary waste. Our idea focuses on
            repurposing unsold goods by making them available to event managers and bulk buyers who can use them immediately, thus
            reducing waste and creating a win-win situation for both retailers and consumers.
        </p>

        <h2>Findings from Our Research</h2>
        <h3>Product Categorization</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>
                Through our discussions, we learned that products in supermarkets are managed in two distinct categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Returnable to Agencies:</strong> Products removed from shelves 1-2 weeks before expiration and returned
                    to suppliers for disposal. Despite being consumable, large amounts of waste are generated as these products are
                    disposed of.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-returnable to Agencies:</strong> Products that cannot be returned are discounted heavily, sometimes
                    up to 50%, but many still remain unsold and are discarded.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Retailer Practices Leading to Waste</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Removal from Shelves:</strong> Items are removed from shelves well before expiration to prevent customers from consuming products after their expiry date, which poses health risks. This practice leads to waste unless the items are discounted or returned.</li>
                <li><strong>Return Policies:</strong> Larger supermarkets like Spar and Big Mart return goods, but agencies often
                    dispose of them instead of repurposing.</li>
                <li><strong>Discounting Practices:</strong> Larger supermarkets heavily discount, but smaller retailers, like
                    MiniMart, struggle due to a lack of infrastructure or incentive.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Developing the Solution: A New Approach to Reducing Retail Food Waste</h2>
        <h3>The Business Model: Connecting Retailers with Event Managers</h3>
        <p>
            Based on our findings, we developed a business model that bridges the gap between retailers looking to offload nearly
            expired stock and event managers or bulk buyers who can use these products immediately. This repurposing reduces waste
            while creating a revenue stream for both retailers and our platform.
        </p>
        <p>The model works as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Inventory System:</strong> Retailers upload nearly expired stock to our platform, where event
                managers can browse real-time product availability based on location.</li>
            <li><strong>On-demand Purchases:</strong> We only purchase stock when there is demand, minimizing the risk of holding
                onto expiring products.</li>
            <li><strong>Tailored Solutions for Event Managers:</strong> Bulk buyers, like event managers, can access deep discounts
                for products that will be consumed quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Discount and Delivery System:</strong> If local products are insufficient, the search area is
                expanded, and prices adjusted to ensure profitability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Potential Impact: Reducing Food Waste While Turning a Profit</h2>
        <h3>Impact on Retailers</h3>
        <p>
            Retailers can reduce food waste by selling nearly expired goods through our platform. In addition to non-returnable items, we will also purchase returnable items from agencies at a significant discount, allowing us to offer more products. This benefits smaller supermarkets by giving them a risk-free way to offload unsellable products while expanding the range of discounted goods available to event managers.

        </p>

        <h3>Impact on Event Managers</h3>
        <p>
            Event managers, who need bulk quantities of food and supplies for hackathons, conferences, and parties, benefit from
            discounted, nearly expired products. This solves their cost challenges while reducing waste.
        </p>

        <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
        <p>
            With 74 million tons of food wasted annually, 13% from retailers, this solution can significantly reduce India's food
            waste. By repurposing products for events, we reduce both environmental impact and economic losses for retailers.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges and Mitigation Strategies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Product Availability:</strong> If specific products are unavailable, suggested alternatives will be offered
                to ensure event managers have options.</li>
            <li><strong>Logistics and Transportation:</strong> A strong logistics network will ensure nearly expired goods are
                delivered swiftly. Local transportation networks will help provide same-day or next-day delivery.</li>
            <li><strong>Trust and Food Safety:</strong> To address safety concerns, we will ensure products meet FSSAI regulations
                and provide transparent expiration data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion: A Sustainable and Profitable Way Forward</h2>
        <p>
            After extensive research, we are confident that our business idea can significantly reduce food waste while turning a
            profit. By connecting retailers with event managers, we create a circular economy where products that would have gone
            to waste are repurposed and used efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our next steps involve discussing the idea with FSSAI, refining the model, and developing the technology to support
            this vision. Together, we can create a future with minimized food waste and smarter, more sustainable consumption
            practices.
